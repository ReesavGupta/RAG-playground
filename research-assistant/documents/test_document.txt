Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Key Concepts:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. Examples include classification and regression tasks.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

3. Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data.

Applications:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Autonomous vehicles

The field continues to evolve rapidly with new techniques and applications being developed regularly.
