# Smart Article Categorizer

A comprehensive system that automatically classifies news articles into 6 categories (Tech, Finance, Healthcare, Sports, Politics, Entertainment) using multiple embedding approaches and provides a web-based interface for real-time classification.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a multi-model article classification system that compares different embedding approaches for text classification. The system provides both a command-line training pipeline and a web-based UI for real-time article classification.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Embedding Models** (4 different approaches):
   - **Word2Vec**: Average word vectors for document representation
   - **BERT**: Uses [CLS] token embeddings from BERT-base-uncased
   - **Sentence-BERT**: Direct sentence embeddings using all-MiniLM-L6-v2
   - **OpenAI**: text-embedding-ada-002 API (optional)

2. **Classification Pipeline**:
   - Logistic Regression classifier trained on each embedding type
   - Performance comparison across all models
   - Real-time prediction with confidence scores

3. **Web Interface**:
   - Streamlit-based web application
   - Real-time article classification
   - Model comparison and visualization
   - Confidence score analysis

## 🔧 Usage

### Training Models

Run the training pipeline to create and save models:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Create a sample dataset with 120 articles (20 per category)
- Train Word2Vec, BERT, and Sentence-BERT models
- Save models to the `models/` directory
